This showed how the molecule conformation can affect the potential energy. An important application for calculating potential energy for the molecule is minimizing it to obtain the most stable and favorable structure for the molecule. Here we will show you how to energy minimize a molecule using Java Molecular Energy. Create a Minimizer For The Molecule The energy minimizer use the force field to calculate the energy and try to change the molecule structure to minimize it. We have different choices for choosing energy minimization algorithm. We will use GradientDescent as the most popular method. MMFF94 mmff = new MMFF94(true); GradientDescent minimizer = new GradientDescent(mmff); Assign Force Field Parameters To The Molecule This step is required as the minimizer will keep calculating the energy of the molecule. mmff.assignParameters(container); Minimize The Energy For The Molecule When calling minimize method the minimizer will block the thread untlin the process finishes. The process is an iterative cycle with each cycle called a step. The minimizer will recieve the maximum steps at wich it will stop after them. Each step the minimizer will try to change the conformation of the molecule depending on the step size. The larger the step the faster the molecule will move to the energy minimum. However, small steps help the minimizer reach the smallest possible energy but with more steps. In this example we called the minimizer to do minimization for 1000 step with 0.1 step size. The final parameter is the threshold. This parameter determins the energy difference that when reached between two steps the minimizer will stop. E.g.: here if the last step minimized the energy by 10kcal, the minimizer will stop. minimizer.minimize(container, 1000, .1f, 10);","title":"Energy Minimization"},{"location":"energy-minimization/#energy-minimization","text":"Previously we saw how to calculate the potential energy for a molecule using Java Molecular Energy.

The force fields have two subdivisions MMFF94 & MMFF94s (stands for static). MMFF94 is the first one that is intended for simulation while MMFF94s is optimized for energy minimization. You can choose which one through the constructor boolean parameter of the force field. Use true for MMFF94s and false for MMFF94. MMFF94 mmff94 = new MMFF94(false); MMFF94 Energy Terms The force field use several terms to calculate potential energy of the molecule. The forces are divided to bonded and non-bonded interactions: * Bonded Interactions: * Bond Stretching: for calculating energy based on the distance between two bonded atoms. * Angle Bending: the angle between three bonded atoms. * Stretch Bend Interaction: A force that increase the bonds when the angle between three bonded atoms decrease. This is used to correct the structure of the molecule. * Torsion: This term forces angle formed between four bonded atoms to be at certain angle. This angle is also called dihydral angle. * Out Of Plane: This term is used to describe the effect of the angle formed when three atoms at least connect to a central atom. Two end atoms and the central atom can form a plane which the third end atom is out of it by certain angle. This term is used usually to correct the Sp2 hybridized central atom planarity. * Non-bonded Interactions: * Van Der Waals: Calculate the van der waals force between two non-bonded atoms. * Electrostatic Interaction: This term calculates electrostatic interaction energy between atoms. Note that not only atoms with formal charges are included as MMFF94 assign partial charges for unionized atoms. ## Implementation MMFF94 instance when first created loads all the force fields parameters needed. Before calculating energy to any molecule you have to assign parameters to this molecule first. This process prevent MMFF94 from searching for proper paramters for the molecule each time you want to calculate the energy. The partial charges are assigned to the molecule and you can retrive them using the following code: java atomContainer.getAtom(0).getCharge(); For more informations about MMFF94 implementation you can see the original papers: Merck molecular force field.
